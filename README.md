# RpgSheetMaker

My eternal sheet-maker project.

This project has two objective : help me fill in character sheets for RPG and serve as a study-basis for Dotnet core.

Currently you can create/read characters for the game Fallout P&P, 
and I will soon add a controller to do the same with Call of Cthulhu (the logic is already written)

I've used the Repository and Factory patterns, and played a bit with DI since it's a core native component.

I plan to add a front-end with Vue.js, and to add features like the edition of a character.

The program is meant to be run locally, and if I was to deploy it it would probably be on a raspberry. 
Should this happen I'd write it here,  but it's highly unprobable.
